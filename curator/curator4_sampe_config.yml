    action: allocation
    description: >-
      Apply shard allocation routing to 'include' 'tag=warm' for hot/warm node
      setup for indices older than x, based on index_creation date.

  3:
    action: forcemerge
    description: >-
      forceMerge prefixed indices older than x (based on index
      creation_date) to 1 segments per shard.  Delay 120 seconds between each
      forceMerge operation to allow the cluster to quiesce.
      This action will ignore indices already forceMerged to the same or fewer
      number of segments per shard, so the 'forcemerged' filter is unneeded.
